# QMSS GR5063 - Data Visualization Assignment 2: AirBnB in New York City

This repository contains raw RMarkdown file and HTML rendered output from one of the course assignments. The vast majority of the projects I did are in Python, so this receptacle provides a bit more of my proficiency in R. Below are the original assignment questions FYI.

### 1. Overall Location

a)  Provide a map to show where in New York City AirBnB listings are located.

b)  Provide a map in which you summarize the density of the AirBnB listings and highlight the hot-spots for AirBnB locations. Make sure to annotate a few hot-spots on the map.

### 2. Renting out your apartment vs. permanent rentals

An Airbnb host can set up a calendar for their listing so that it is only available for a few days or weeks a year. Other listings are available all year round (except for when it is already booked). Entire homes or apartments highly available and rented frequently year-round to tourists probably don't have the owner present, are illegal, and more importantly, are displacing New Yorkers.

a)  Choose a combination of *both maps and non-mapping visualizations (graphs or tables)* to explore where in NYC listings are available sporadically vs. year-round. Make sure to highlight the neighborhoods were most listings appear to be permanent or semi-permanent rentals.

b)  Some hosts (identified by `host_id`) operate multiple rentals. Provide a data table of the the top hosts, the total number of listings they are associated with, the average nightly price, and the estimated average monthly total income from these listings.

### 3. Top Reviewed Rentals

Provide an interactive map which shows the Top 100 most expensive and Top 100 best reviewed rentals in NYC. The map should differentiate these two groups and upon clicking on a point on the map should show some basic information (at least 3 pieces of information) in a tool tip.
